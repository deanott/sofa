# **The Sofa Staircase Dilemma**

Would it not be really useful to know before you buy a piece of furniture whether it’s actually going to fit up the stairs or around the
corner.  So I’ve modelled the problem in three dimensions on my computer and so far it just says no way.

That it can’t be done.  I told it to compute the moves necessary to get the sofa out,
and it said there aren’t any.  I said “What?” and it said there aren’t any.  I then asked it, and this is the really mysterious
thing, to compute the moves necessary to get the sofa into its present position in the first place, and it said that it
have got there.  Not without fundamental restructuring of the walls.  So, either there’s something wrong with the fundamental structure of the matter in my walls or,’ he added with a sigh, ‘there’s something wrong with the program.  Which would you guess?
